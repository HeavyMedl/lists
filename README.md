Lists is a library of higher-order functions featuring over 50 recursive functions for working with lists (arrays/strings) and collections (objects).  The library was inspired directly from Haskell's Data.List module by the powerful people over at [The University of Gasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).  You can view the original source [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.0/docs/src/Data-List.html).  You could then scroll through each function closely and see a purposefully similar correlation between the Haskell implementation and [this](www.google.com) implementation.

You'll take advantage of the endless combinations of function compositions that Lists offers you.  Use the unorthodox style of passing functions to functions to functions to solve complex problems.  Most of the functions featured in Lists produce new arrays, to reinforce the paradigm of stateless programming, which means "retaining no information about previous events".

Because javascript does not yet support [tail call optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call), most of these functions are naive recursive implementations.  Eventually Lists will feature a [continuous-passing style (CPS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style) which should impact its performance.  For now, enjoy the elegant recursion ;P

Lists is an open source project and is not meant to be paid for, ever.  So now then, lets have some fun(fun(fun(fun)))

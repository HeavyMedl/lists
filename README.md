Lists is a library of higher-order functions featuring over 50 functions for working with lists (arrays/strings) and collections (objects).  The library was inspired directly from Haskell's Data.List module by the powerful people over at [The University of Gasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).  You can view the original source [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.0/docs/src/Data-List.html). You could then scroll through each function closely and see a purposefully similar correlation between the Haskell implementation and [this](www.google.com) implementation.

You'll take advantage of the endless combinations of function compositions that Lists offers you.  Use the unorthodox style of passing functions to functions to functions to solve complex problems.  Most of the functions featured in Lists produce new arrays, to reinforce the paradigm of stateless programming, which means "retaining no information about previous events".

Lists will feature both recursive and iterative implementations of its functions.  For performance reasons, the module that you pull from node package manager will be the iterative version of Lists. ECMAScript 6 will support [tail call optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) which will make the performance of carefully designed recursive functions a viable contender (in the way of performance) to their iterative counter parts. A present alternative is using [continuous-passing style CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style) to define recursive functions - this will be slowly implemented.

Lists is an open source project and is not meant to be paid for, ever.  So now then, lets have some fun(fun(fun(fun)))

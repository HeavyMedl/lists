Lists is a higher-order function utility library featuring over 50 recursive functions for working primarily with lists (arrays/strings) and collections (objects).  The library was inspired directly from Haskell's Data.List module by the powerful people over at [The University of Gasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).  You can view the original source [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.0/docs/src/Data-List.html).  You could then scroll through each function closely and see a purposefully similar correlation between the Haskell implementation and [this](www.google.com) implementation.

You'll take advantage of the endless combinations of function compositions that Lists offers you.  Use the unorthodox style of passing functions to functions to functions to solve complex problems.  Most of the functions featured in Lists produce new arrays, to reinforce the paradigm of stateless programming, which means to "retaining no information about previous events".

Lists is an open source project and is not meant to be paid for, ever.  So now then, lets have some fun(fun(fun(fun)))
